### Prof. Keh's Overview on China's Supply Chains

- China has been intentionally raising the minimum wage every 5-years and at a much
faster clip than inflation so it is intentionally pricing itself out of the market
  - This is to bring the Chinese population out of poverty
  - Leads to a discussion of onshoring or shifting to cheaper cost of labor economies
- China's Problems with Contract Manufacturing
    <br><img src="imgs/shoe.png" width=600px>
  - First $88 stay with footlocker, the retailer
  - Nike's wholesale price of $40 don't go to China
  - Rubber, Suede and other raw materials are imported in
  - Bottom-line that China gets to keep is $1.50
  - Cost of this $1.50 profit is the tremendous pollution and social issues so
        China is trying to pivot away from contract manufacturing
- Vietnam is gaining interest, but the entire size of Vietnam is equivalent to
    a single province in China
- Why Nation's Fail: there is a very strong tradeoff between coercion and innovation
  - China currently has a balance between both of them
  - Can you continue to innovate sustainably where there is a significant level of coercion
  - AI is actually one use case where systems that centrally locate data have an
        advantage over distributed systems
  - We are in a new data-driven regime unlike any we have seen before, which might be
        what is giving the nation an advantage
- The further west in China you go, the more complicated the infrastructure is going to be,
    so eCommerce is a leveler because it gives everyone access to the same marketplaces
  - Every year 300M people join the middle-class who have not seen any other
        way to shop than eCommerce
  - India is also similarly exciting because you have different groups of people with language
        barriers, tastes, etc.

### Dean Garrett's Session

- In both countries there is a lot of domestic turmoil going on, so it can be useful to pin it on the other superpower
- Bill Clinton explicitly said in support of China's admission to the WTO that the more we integrate
    China, the more they will become like us; there is now a consensus that China is no longer
    willing to play the same game US is playing and that this is new

#### US Companies

##### GM

- In 2019, GM sold more cars in China than in the USA. All these cars were made in a JV with a Chinese communist
    company
- GM did not want you to know this; they only came back to profitability based on their sales in China
- Chinese government and corporations have now decided that GM is evil because they are aligned with the US
- What should GM do about this? Production needs to be closer to the market than the home country, so producing
    in Detroit and exporting to China is not an option

##### Starbucks

Most of the global growth of Starbucks in the last 5 years has been in China

##### Tesla

- Rise in stock price of Tesla started when they announced the opening of their new plant outside of Shanghai
- Producing largely for the Chinese market, with the option for export
- Not in a JV

##### Apple

- Tim Cook is not shy about speaking to the importance of China in manufacturing
  - He mentioned it's not because of cost, but talent and quality
  - Quality of tooling engineers is best in China
- Producing in China is now more expensive than producing in Mexico
    because of tariffs, but US is still 27% more expensive
    <br><img src="imgs/apple.png" width=800px><br>
- China is the second largest market for Apple devices now as well; iPhones are still a status symbol

##### Takeaways

Company's just try to fly under the radar to the extent that they can

#### Chinese Companies - Huawei

<br><img src="imgs/huawei.png" width=800px><br>

- US is a taker of technology and standards related to 5G; related to step-down in government
    investment in technology post-war
- Qualcomm, Broadcom and Flex lobby Washington DC to not be as strict on Huawei because of the danger
    it poses on their supply chains
    <br><img src="imgs/huawei_friends.png" width=700px><br>
- Huawei is making contingency plans to become a China-only company, but their entire future
    is being appended because of politics and not underlying economics

#### Global China

- Largest infrastructure investor in the world
    <br><img src="imgs/infra.png" width=800px><br>
- Expand market access
  - Africa; raw materials
  - Europe; more markets
- Have great infrastructure and want to export it
- Want more friends on the global stage

#### Five-Eyes, Quad

**Quad**: Japan, India, Australia, USA

- Anti-China move
- India has gone from being on the sidelines on national security issues to
    siding with the USA
- Will see a lot of alliance of democracy talk this and in the coming years against China

**Five-Eyes**: UK, Australia, New Zealand, USA, Canada; Intelligence-sharing agreement
which is important for Australia to be a member of because of their unique satellite
coverage of the southern-hemisphere

## Supply Chain Overview and JD Case Discussion 3.23.2021

### Supply Chain Overview

#### Overview

1. Network that connects everything from procurement all the way to the customer (PoS)
1. **What flows in the supply chain:** 
    1. Product: flows from producer to consumer; also have reverse logistics going the other way
    1. Money: Timing of cashflows is a problem because a supplier is putting money into raw materials now but customer only pays after the entire product is manufactured and gets sold
        1. Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC): Apple and Amazon have -30days CCC
        1. Solution: Cash refactoring; e.g. Greensill Capital
    1. Information: flows both ways; Amazon for e.g. is very reluctant to give customer data, although they do want to share aggregate information
1. **Goal of supply chains:**
    1. Match supply and demand
    1. Maximize supply chain surplus; need to think supply chain as end-to-end entity and maximize the size of the pie
        1. Individual firms should care about this because of [double marginalization](https://www.careeranna.com/articles/double-marginalization/#:~:text=Double%20Marginalization%20is%20the%20phenomenon,their%20own%20markups%20in%20prices.)
        1. Wholesaler chooses wholesale price and retail price sets market price; both entities maximize individual profit by adding a margin
        1. Optimal solution is to mazimie the collective profit; buyback contracts and other agreements try to improve visibiltiy and coordinate actions
        <br><img src="imgs/double_margin.png" width=500><br>

#### Assess Alignment and Fit in Supply Chain

1. To what extent is the customer imposing additional uncertainity to your supply chain
    1. Quantity of product needed
    1. Response time customers will tolerate
    1. Variety of products needed
    1. Service Level required
    1. Price of product
    1. Desired rate of innovation of the product
    <br><img src="imgs/uncertainty.png" width=500><br>
1. How responsive is the supply chain to:
    1. Responding to wide range of quantities
    1. Meeting short lead times
    1. Handling large varieties of products
    1. Meeting high service level
1. Strategic Fit
    <br><img src="imgs/strategic_fit.png" width=500><br>
    1. Below the zone of strategic fit: long tail of customer demand
        1. 80-20 Pareto rule assumes 80% of profit comes from top-20 SKUs, and this assumption is broken by e-commerce companies like Amazon, JD, etc.
        1. Firms on the efficient end of the supply chain make money by pooling demand
    1. Above the zone of strategic fit: bespoke manufacturers; not at all predictable demand
    1. **StitchFix vs GAP**
        1. Stitchfix has very certain and efficient supply chain
        1. GAP has very uncertain demand; traditional retail is very unpredictable and they have to build a supply chain to deal with that

- Cainiao is a coordination platform for 3PL providers
- Most products are 3P-merchants owned; JD is more of a 1P model
- Cainiao is like UPS / FedEx; a merchant / customer can select who they want their goods delivered by, and the network makes it happen

#### History of Tencent

![History](imgs/tencent_history.png)

##### Agenda for expanding internationally

- Cloud: privacy issues are prevalent, and this is a major blocker
- Payments: privacy issues, same as cloud
- Gaming: no limitations for international expansion; seeing massive growth in this vertical

##### Specific regions as targets for international expansion

- If a lot of Chinese tourists go somewhere, we try to make it available there. E.g. Japan, Bay Area, etc.
- Biggest blocker for international expansion is that some other messaging applications have already gained traction

#### Mini Program

Mini-program vs website:

![Mini](imgs/tencent_app_vs_site.png)
![Mini](imgs/tencent_program_eg.png)

Setting up your own WeChat ecosystem using mini-programs

#### Mini Games

![Games](imgs/tencent_games.png)

#### Business Communication: WeChat Work

![Work](imgs/tencent_slack.png)

#### WeChat Pay

- Catching up with AliPay in the payments game when WeChat Pay started
- Started with WeChat Red Envelope: like a social game
- Different from AliPay, which is pure payments, because this has social aspect of money transfer

![Payments](imgs/tencent_pay.png)

##### PoS Methods using WeChat Pay

- Cut is lower than what credit cards take
- Not bypassing credit / debit cards; still go through the bank
- Both AliPay and WeChat Pay are working on facial recognition for payment authentication

![Payments](imgs/tencent_payments.png)

##### Comparison with Ant Financial

- Tencent does not want to get into financial lending because it is too risky and attracts government attraction
- WeChat does offer lending, but in a much more conservative way

#### WeChat Games

- Contribute to 50% of WeChat revenue
- 33% of total Tencent revenue comes from games

![eSports](imgs/tencent_esports.png)

#### WeChat Advertising

- **Neo's anecdotal evidence:** on Facebook, you see a lot of personalized advertising but its not too accurate
- Tencent has more brand ads, instead of geared towards conversion
- Tencent allows you to have more experiences behind ads than other platforms with linked miniprograms, etc.

![Ads](imgs/tencent_official_acct.png)
![Ads](imgs/tencent_program_ads.png)

#### Market Competition

- Whenever a new social media app comes out, like ClubHouse, everyone thinks they are potential competitors
- Have seen several market cycles of new social media, and we've survived through everything
- Dominate in social networks, but need to keep improving our experience

### [JD Case Notes](https://github.com/sheilsarda/ResearchNotes/blob/master/china_supply_chains/Cases/JD%20Envisioning%20the%20Future%20of%20Retail%20(A).pdf)

#### Overview of JD and Chinese Retail Landscape

1. Second largest e-commerce company in China by Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV)
1. Offer same-or-next-day delivery as a standard service for Chinese customers
1. In 2016, China surpassed the United States as the world’s largest retail market; its total 2016 sales was $4.886 trillion compared to $4.823 trillion in the U.S
1. Offline retail stores make up approximately 85% of China’s total retail market; in the US, this is 78.7% of total retail sales in 2020
1. JD coined the term “boundary less retail” to describe retail in the digital age. According to JD, retailing had become boundary less in the following ways:
    1. There were no physical boundaries to where and when consumers shopped. They could shop online, offline, on their computers, or on their mobile phones
    1. Second, products had transcended their traditional uses. They might come with services and/or content and collect data simultaneously
    1. Third, retailers must move beyond traditional ways of selling
    online or in stores and engage with consumers to provide a personalized shopping experience

![JD](imgs/jd_bamboo.png)
![JD](imgs/china_retail_revolution.png)

#### JD History

Despite its late arrival, JD distinguished itself among competitors with a staunch commitment to customer service and a zero tolerance policy toward counterfeits. To Liu, the essence of retail was about operating cost, efficiency, and customer experience

On some other e-commerce platforms, those sellers that sell counterfeits could charge the same prices as sellers selling authentic products, and as a result, they have money to advertise on these platforms, and sometimes drive their competitors out of the market or convert them into counterfeit sellers. The platforms can profit from these ads and may not have incentives to intervene

Shortly before its 2014 IPO, JD entered into a five-year strategic cooperation agreement and an eight-year non-compete agreement with Tencent, owner of the popular WeChat and Mobile QQ apps. The partnership gave JD access to the world’s largest mobile user base—WeChat’s over 1 billion active users

JD’s partnership with Yonghui in 2015, China’s top supermarket that operated more than 500 local neighborhood stores, gave the company the capacity to offer fresh foods

In 2016, JD formed a strategic partnership with Walmart. Walmart had entered China’s e-commerce market in 2011 by investing in Yihaodian, an e-commerce firm. But the venture was unsuccessful because it could not compete with Alibaba’s and JD’s dominance in e-commerce

Thus in June 2016, Walmart sold its e-commerce operations to JD for an initial 5.0% stake. The stake increased to 10.1% by February 2017.  Under this partnership, JD would carry over 1,700 of the most popular items in Walmart’s physical stores in China and fulfill the orders with Dada’s logistics

This partnership would expand JD’s offerings in imported products, and consumers could buy them directly from the Walmart store on JD. In return, with access to JD’s customers, delivery network, and big data, Walmart would boost its sales and improve its customer service

#### JD Supply Chain

Liu developed an inverted triangle model to show how JD delivered top customer service with great efficiency
![Triangle](imgs/jd_triangle.png)

Its distribution centers had three tiers:
    - regional distribution centers
    - forward distribution centers
    - town distribution centers

We call this process **short chain**

- Short chain reduces the number of movements [of goods] and cuts down on transportation distance
- Typically, in order to get merchandise from a warehouse to customer, the merchandise might be transported four to five times or more
- JD wants to reduce the entire number of movements to one or two times

Because JD sourced many products by itself, the team relied on demand forecasting to determine how many of certain products to source at certain times of the year

#### Future of Chinese Commerce

Alibaba New Retail:

1. A key feature of Hema was its ability to deliver orders within 3 kilometers within 30 minutes
1. As of 2015, Alibaba had opened 13 Hema markets—ten in Shanghai, two in Beijing, and one in Ningbo—and each store served customers within a three-kilometer radius so Hema could provide fast and high-quality service
1. Furthermore, Hema also had its own logistics system, with an in-store warehouse that allowed order-fulfillment specialists to scan, pack up the goods and send them to the delivery center nearby quickly
1. With such efficient distribution network, each Hema store was able to fulfill thousands of orders a day
1. Hema’s customers made about 4.5 purchases per month and 50 times a year
    1. Once a user opened the app, their likelihood of making a purchase was 35%
    1. Online orders made up more than 50% of total orders
1. “Hema is a showcase of the new business opportunities that emerges from online-offline integration,” Daniel Zhang, Alibaba Group CEO, remarked

### Jon Huntsman Jr. - Former US Ambassador to China

![Jon Huntsman](imgs/jon_huntsman.png)

1. Private sector is more likely to bring change in China based on best-practices in business
1. To what extent did the previous administration shape what's going to happen in the future
    1. China has arrived on the global scene and their confidence is very high
    1. Test them the first little while to see how they are going to respond
        1. Expect something in the South and East China Sea
        1. Expect more bluster on the negotiation tables
        1. They are now willing to take on the US in the public eye and calling people out
1. The question in boardrooms right now is to what extent do we need to go full-throttle in China vs hedging our bets by managing supply chains in various countries
   1. At what point does this get politicized
   1. Backlash could be people boycotting products, strikes in front of your manufacturing plants
   1. Biden is going to find areas where there is collaboration with China, and will work with US allies
1. Many of our allies are waiting for a grand strategy that can be sustained
   1. We are put on the defensive when dealing with countries who have a longer-term trade strategy
   1. Amy Schumer is going to come forward with a Christmas tree style agenda with a lot of amendments and a plan to get Capitol Hill unified
1. Taiwan: what does our security guarantee for Taiwan mean; is there a de-escalation strategy?
   1. Economic strategy with Taiwan has always been robust, especially in the semiconductor sector
   1. Nvidia and Intel are going long in the US, which will reduce some importance of Taiwan as a trading partner

#### About Retail's performance since COVID

1. Clothing and accessories is down 15% but the retail category as a whole is up 15%
1. Retail supports 1 out of every 4 jobs in the US, so when retail takes a hit, everything does
1. Largest string of bankruptcies in 10 years; lost 11,000 fashion stores
1. Had way too much space (sq. feet per person) and COVID only accelerated this vacating of space

#### US China Trade War and Retail

1. Trump tried to manually balance trade with China, whereas this should expand and contract based on looseness of the economic climate
1. Economist Peter Navarro escalated this issue further by trumping up charges on China
1. Apparel and Footwear were not included in tranche 1 and 2, but they started nipping at this category from tranche 3
1. Prior to US China tariffs, this category already had tariffs with 20% duty from Smoot-Hawley; China is our number one supplier, and 40% of our apparel market
1.
