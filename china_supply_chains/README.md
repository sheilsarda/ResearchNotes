### Prof. Keh's Overview on China's Supply Chains

- China has been intentionally raising the minimum wage every 5-years and at a much
faster clip than inflation so it is intentionally pricing itself out of the market
	- This is to bring the Chinese population out of poverty
	- Leads to a discussion of onshoring or shifting to cheaper cost of labor economies
- China's Problems with Contract Manufacturing

	- First $88 stay with footlocker, the retailer
	- Nike's wholesale price of $40 don't go to China
	- Rubber, Suede and other raw materials are imported in
	- Bottom-line that China gets to keep is $1.50
	- Cost of this $1.50 profit is the tremendous pollution and social issues so 
		China is trying to pivot away from contract manufacturing
- Vietnam is gaining interest, but the entire size of Vietnam is equivalent to 
	a single province in China
- Why Nation's Fail: there is a very strong tradeoff between coercion and innovation
	- China currently has a balance between both of them
	- Can you continue to innovate sustainably where there is a significant level of coercion
	- AI is actually one usecase where systems that centrally locate data have an 
		advantage over distributed systems
	- We are in a new data-driven regime unlike any we have seen before, which might be 
		what is giving the nation an advantage
