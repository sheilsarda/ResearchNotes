### Prof. Keh's Overview on China's Supply Chains

- China has been intentionally raising the minimum wage every 5-years and at a much
faster clip than inflation so it is intentionally pricing itself out of the market
	- This is to bring the Chinese population out of poverty
	- Leads to a discussion of onshoring or shifting to cheaper cost of labor economies
- China's Problems with Contract Manufacturing

	- First $88 stay with footlocker, the retailer
	- Nike's wholesale price of $40 don't go to China
	- Rubber, Suede and other raw materials are imported in
	- Bottom-line that China gets to keep is $1.50
	- Cost of this $1.50 profit is the tremendous pollution and social issues so 
		China is trying to pivot away from contract manufacturing
- Vietnam is gaining interest, but the entire size of Vietnam is equivalent to 
	a single province in China
- Why Nation's Fail: there is a very strong tradeoff between coercion and innovation
	- China currently has a balance between both of them
	- Can you continue to innovate sustainably where there is a significant level of coercion
	- AI is actually one usecase where systems that centrally locate data have an 
		advantage over distributed systems
	- We are in a new data-driven regime unlike any we have seen before, which might be 
		what is giving the nation an advantage
- The further west in China you go, the more complicated the infrastructure is going to be,
	so eCommerce is a leveler because it gives everyone access to the same marketplaces
	- Every year 300M people join the middle-class who have not seen any other 
		way to shop than eCommerce
	- India is also similarly exciting because you have different groups of people with language
		barriers, tastes, etc.

### Dean Garrett's Session

- In both countries there is a lot of domestic turmoil going on, so it can be useful to pin it on the other superpower
- Bill Clinton explicitly said in support of China's admission to the WTO that the more we integrate
	China, the more they will become like us; there is now a consensus that China is no longer
	willing to play the same game US is playing and that this is new

#### GM

- In 2019, GM sold more cars in China than in the USA. All these cars were made in a JV with a Chinese communist
	company
- GM did not want you to know this; they only came back to profitability based on their sales in China
- Chinese government and corporations have now decided that GM is evil because they are aligned with the US
- What should GM do about this? Production needs to be closer to the market than the home country, so producing
	in Detroit and exporting to China is not an option

#### Starbucks

Most of the global growth of Starbucks in the last 5 years has been in China

#### Tesla

- Rise in stock price of Tesla started when they announced the opening of their new plant outside of Shanghai
- Producing largely for the Chinese market, with the option for export

#### Apple

- Tim Cook is not shy about speaking to the importance of China in manufacturing
	- He mentioned it's not because of cost, but talent and quality
	- Quality of tooling engineers is best in China
- Producing in China is now more expensive than producing in Mexico
	because of tariffs, but US is still 27% more expensive

- China is the second largest market for Apple devices now as well; iPhones are still a status symbol

#### Takeaways

Company's just try to fly under the radar to the extent that they can
