  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">When the two did merge, Bay Networks was actually larger than Cisco, and there was talk of a new gorilla in the industry. Very quickly, however, the market whittled Bay back down to size as Cisco swept past it. This was hugely frustrating for the management at Bay, leading ultimately to wholesale changes in its executive ranks, because investors assumed that management teams must have erred badly. It was just a case, however, of a prince (SynOptics) plus a chimp (Wellfleet) being no match for a gorilla. This was made particularly true in light of two additional markets that were coming on-line at the same time. In both cases, the gorilla Cisco acquired presence in these markets and then leveraged its gorilla strength to create new areas of market dominance.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">By 1993 the networking industry was large and growing rapidly, comprising the markets for intelligent hubs, network routers, and LAN switches. Revenues that year would total approximately $3 billion, an increase of 85% from the prior year's total. Where did this new category of LAN switches come from? From the insatiable need to improve bandwidth.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Basically, networks were becoming victims of their own success. Network usage began to accelerate to the point that the current infrastructure simply could not handle the strain. The most obvious problem was <i>bandwidth</i>, the ability of the network to move traffic without delays. It is precisely analogous to the problem of overcrowded freeways. Intelligent hubs, in their original configuration, improved manageability but did not increase bandwidth. Network routers could increase bandwidth by segmenting network traffic into separate sections or workgroups; but routers were expensive, not particularly fast, and difficult to manage in large numbers. In the simplest sense, networks needed a new devicesomething that offered the simplicity of the intelligent hub architecture with some of the intelligence of the network router.</font></td>
