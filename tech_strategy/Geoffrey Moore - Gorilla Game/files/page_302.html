Web search engines are a combination of enabling software and Web directories, a tornado play in which Yahoo, Excite, Lycos, Infoseek, and Alta Vista are all visible, with Yahoo the dominating player. But as we have repeatedly noted, these engines control no proprietary interface, so switching costs are low. It is just barely possible someone could come up with a radically new proprietary set of search algorithmsthe problem certainly could use some more horsepower applied to itbut we do not know of any. So we see this as a king/prince/serf market based largely on branding, and not a gorilla game.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3"><i>Document distribution and management</i> are at the heart of a huge deployment of Internet-enabled infrastructure inside major corporations. These intranets have been the focus of the enabling software competition between netscape and Microsoft, and that gorilla game will continue for some time to come. The fight is over both the browser and the server software, which we would categorize collectively as communications applications. The reason Microsoft seems so well positioned against Netscape is that it has a strong position in a second underlying battle between two operating systems, Unix and Windows NT. Because it was able to displace Novell Netware, NT is perceived as the de facto standard OS for workgroups. Most corporations, therefore, are inclined to expand NT's role to incorporate the Web-server as well, in the hopes of keeping the overall network administration task down to a minimum. To the degree Microsoft wins the OS war for the workgroup Web-server, it can use its control over the underlying standard to maneuver Netscape out of position in the browser battle. Meanwhile, the computer hardware vendorsSun with Unix, Compaq and Digital with NT, and HP and IBM with offers in both campsall are experiencing tornado demand for their</font></td>
