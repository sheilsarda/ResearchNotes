  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Irked and offended by this state of affairs, engineers in the engineering school built a computer system that would allow the two respective computer networks to interoperate. The engineers called this device a network router because it could ''route" network traffic from one network to another. That is, it translated traffic from the business school's network to that of the computer science department, and vice versa. As a result, Lerner and Bosack could send e-mail back and forth to each other. Love will find a way.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">At the same time, larger forces were at workwell, not larger than love, but larger than networking at Stanford. Engineers were attempting to scale up the Internet, and they faced a problem analagous to that which had troubled the company's founders. The problem was at once more simple and more complex. On the simplification side, every computer on the Internet spoke Unix and TCP/IP, the networking protocol. There was nothing like the HP 3000/9000 incompatibility problem. But there were interoperability issues nonetheless, because no two vendors' implementation of Unix is identical. And while the glitches themselves may have been minor by comparison, the fact that there were so many different computers in so many different interactions made the problem hugely complex. Transporting e-mail between this huge variety of disparate computer systems became a maintenance nightmare, and the time and effort it was taking to tweak these systems to communicate with each other was becoming a serious obstacle to the Internet's growth. The Cisco sales force took their story on the road, and it soon became obvious that Cisco Systems had solved this very problem.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Thus the router market was born. But at that stage, it was still in the early market. That is, most customers were technology enthusiasts from the public sector, not pragmatists from the private side. These users did not care about Cisco's financial performance, the company's size or its origin. They just needed a device to help scale up the Net. As customers, they did not need a sophisticated or competitive marketing program either. Indeed, in many cases it was they who sought out and found Cisco, not the other way around.</font></td>
