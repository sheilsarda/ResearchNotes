  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">time, but here the leader from the outset was PeopleSoft. It captured over 50% of the early HR market and has held that market share ever since. PeopleSoft's story is a classic example of using bowling alley strategy to cross the chasm. They got their value chain going early within the confines of a single department's concerns. This allowed them to achieve a local gorilla status in HR, which they have subsequently leveraged into gorilla candidacy both in financials and in manufacturing.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">The manufacturing applications category was originally dominated by SAP, but more recently it has opened up in two ways that are creating additional possibilities. First of all, a series of value-adding applications has emerged and given rise to a raft of new vendors, including Manugistics and I2 in <i>supply-chain software</i> (with Datalogix being acquired by Oracle, and Red Pepper by PeopleSoft), Trilogy and Calico in <i>order configuration software</i>, and Sherpa and Aspect Development in <i>product data management software</i>. All of these categories add value on top of a basic ERP system. All of them also live currently in a curiously ambiguous state: Is their future to be a partner to the major ERP systems, or a competitor?</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">To date, that is, all these companies have a significant lead in functionality over the established ERP vendors; but going forward, if customers decide they want to have one-stop shopping, it is not clear what would prevent a major ERP vendor from just buying one or more of these companies and offering the capability itself. This in turn would put the new vendors in conflict with the very same sales channel that currently provides them comarketing support. For now, however, cooperation serves both parties, so there is a working alliance to develop the market together. But this begs the key question: How sustainable is the competitive advantage of these value-adding vendors? As we shall see in a moment, this same question gets raised in the front office space as well.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">The other way that the ERP category has opened up is along the dimension of complexity. SAP is a very complex system to implement, and while the major corporations may not find that daunting, the rest of the planet does. This creates opportunities for alternative vendors as the market shifts from the largest customers to the middle tier.</font></td>
