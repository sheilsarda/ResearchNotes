  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">The chart shows two moments of gorilla victory for Oracle. The first of these came in the 19981990 period, when it broke away from Informix and RTI (RTI is not illustrated). The second began with the high-tech recovery in 1992 and has never looked back. The distance between Oracle and its competitors today is staggeringunless you understand the dynamics of the gorilla game.</font></td>

You sold off Informix either at the same time or in March of 1995. Each time, you put the money back into Oracle.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">What are the results? Well, you missed the rebound of Sybase in the latter half of 1994; but more important, you missed the collapse of the stock on its first-quarter 1995 loss. Even though it subsequently rebounded somewhat from that catastrophe, it was no longer able to sustain its database positioning, and by 1996 was repositioning itself for the Internet and away from packaged client/server application support. By mid-1997 it was in limbo as the market waited to see what progress it could make on this repositioning.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">As for Informix, in hindsight you definitely got out too soon, your ideal exit being at the beginning of 1996. But you missed its 1996 first-quarter drop, and more important, its 1997 first-quarter catastrophe, when like Sybase, it fell out of the game. As of the middle of 1997, Informix was painfully depositioned for any form of progress. Specifically, having become overly enamored of its next new technology, object-relational databases, it had sought to feature it in a bid to overtake Oracle, even though the product category had not even crossed the chasm. This turned out to be a very bad decision. It was taken however, somewhat out of desperation, as Informix needed to differentiate itself from Oracle's increasingly powerful de facto standard. The result was that customers hesitated to buy the new databases, but also held back from buying the old ones, deciding instead to buy Oracle took its retribution swiftly. There are no easy alternatives for a chimp in a gorilla's grasp.</font></td>
