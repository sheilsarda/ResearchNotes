  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">(A note in passing: The stock market is an ''it," and by conventional usage, things we call "it" cannot think. Nonetheless, we will continue to attribute intelligence to it. Our view is that the stock market operates like a hive of bees. It exhibits behavior that, in light of its ends, appears both rational and considered. Now, in fact, these responses are simply selected from a much larger population of random responses, and what we are really witnessing is a Darwinian mechanism that generates the illusion of rationality. That being said, of course, the same concepts could just as easily be applied to people. So we feel there is at least as good a case for attributing intelligence to the stock market as to the human race.)</font></td>

High-tech markets are ever-shifting terrains, and no company is exempt from being deposed, a lesson IBM taught many of us, much to ourand itschagrin. Whenever a new technology successfully takes the stage, one or more traditional gorillas are bound to fall. And since new technologies are coming faster and faster, no hegemony is secure from substitution threat. There will come a time to sell Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, and Oracleindeed, in the case of Oracle, unless it makes some more definitive response to Microsoft's incursions into relational databases than it has to date, the time may come relatively soon.</font></td>
