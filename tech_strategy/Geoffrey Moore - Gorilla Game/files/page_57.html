  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">This, essentially, is the history of Apple Computer's strategy for the late 1980s and early 1990s. Apple's subsequent problem-filled history emerged only after the PC market moved onto Main Street. At that point two bad things happened from their stockholders' point of view: The gorilla never stumbled, and the company lost patience and focus. It tried to assault the gorilla in its stronghold of corporate IS. Unfortunately, because its chimp architecture required its own dedicated support, Apple's partners could not afford all the software adjustments necessary to make this assault viable. And once Microsoft's Windows 3.1 made a graphical user interface available in a DOS-compatible form, there was no inherent weakness in the gorilla's armor to exploit. Apple got caught outside its own castle, was cut off, lost direction, and as of this writing is having to completely rethink its options in the PC industry.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">This kind of problem is inherent in the chimp position on Main Street. It is not that its existing customers defect. It is rather that every new customer coming onto the market, seeing the gorilla as the standard, tends to join the latter's camp, so over time chimp market shares necessarily erode. As this happens, the partners so necessary to fielding a complete solution begin to defect, for although they like their more privileged position in the chimp's value chain, they can no longer get enough new revenue from it to justify the commitment. This in turn further weakens the value of the chimp offer, hastening further erosion in market share, and making for a truly vicious cycle. The correct short-term response for the chimp is to develop new niche markets, but these are often hard to find and not always available. The correct long-term response is to find a new tornado.</font></td>
