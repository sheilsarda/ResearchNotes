  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">As the table shows, the early market was initially dominated by Shiva, who marketed primarily to corporations. Shiva's technology did incorporate proprietary elements, and had the market gone into the tornado at this stage, they might have become a gorilla in the corporate market. Meanwhile, Ascend Communications, who marketed primarily to Internet service providers (ISPs), could not impose architectural control on the customers. What it had instead was a dominant niche market presence in the Internet access sector, which made it a very strong prince overall. Before we could see how this battle would play out, U.S. Robotics entered the market with a nonproprietary, low-cost solution for corporations. This new product basically cut Shiva's market share in half because of the density, scalability, and price performance of its products. In addition, Shiva licensed part of its remote access software technology to Microsoft to be incorporated into Windows 95, making it harder for all of the vendors to differentiate their access products with client software. This competitive challenge had a devastating effect on Shiva's stock price, although the stock made an impressive comeback during 1996 as the company attempted to reposition itself as an alternate vendor to Ascend in the ISP market. Ascend, by contrast, was relatively immune to this development, because it was establishing itself as the dominate vendor into the market for Internet access. This market position did drive some economies of scale as well as moderate switching costs within its installed base. In the end, Ascend emerged as the key vendor to large ISPs, while U.S. Robotics emerged as the primary vendor to smaller ISPs because of its analog technology, and to the corporate market.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Going forward into 1995, Ascend and U.S. Robotics rose to prominence as strong princes, neither one able to knock the other one far enough back to establish a king status, both reasonably content to dominate in their home sectors of ISPs and corporations, respectively. Now the question arises, both for this chapter and for the industry as a whole, <i>where was Cisco in all this?</i></font></td>
