  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">technology standards to interface all this proliferation of new products into the existing infrastructure of systems. Unfortunately, because the market is just taking off, there are no such standards, nor in the midst of hypergrowth is there time to deliberate upon them. So the market makes do with de facto standards, basing these on the product architecture of the market-leading vendor.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">This is a hugely significant outcome. Whichever vendor is fortunate enough to become the standard-setter in the new market is virtually guaranteed a role in any solution that a complementary partner proposes. If one has the standard database, for example, then every hardware vendor wants it to run on their hardware, every software application vendor wants it to run under their application, and every customer wants it because that way their systems are guaranteed to be compatible with the future releases of all these companies. The power that is thrust upon this vendor, in other words, is awesome.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Vendors, of course, are very much aware of this process, and very much aware of its consequences, so they do all kinds of marketing communications work to try to influence the outcome. It is all a bit like the presidential election primaries in the U.S. As long as the outcome is in doubt, no one has real power, although many will claim it. But as soon as a clear leader emerges, everyone wants to get on their bandwagon, and pretty soon no one else is left in the race. It is this same bandwagon effect that creates the hugely disproportionate demand for the gorilla's products, which drives up their sales volumes and price margins, which makes all the other companies rush to support their offers, which adds even more value to their offers, and which culminates in a market valuation that often outstrips its closest competitor <i>by an order of magnitude!</i></font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Once achieved, the gorilla position is virtually unassailable. Not only has the company itself become rich and powerful, but also all the other vested interests in the market have a motive to keep it in power. Here's why. A new marketplace has just come into being on a mass market scale. The gorilla architecture is acting something like a reef upon which this new ecosystem has sprung up, and therefore every living thing in the system has a stake in keeping it stable (including the customers).</font></td>
