In a world of robbers and terrorists, a zero rate of return might be perceived as goodat least you get to keep your money. In a protection racket, you are actually asked to do worse than thatpay a fee to keep your money. But in a free market, zero is rock bottom for most of us.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3"> The next line up represents the return you could earn from putting money in a "risk-free" investment such as a treasury bond or CD. The idea here is that the investment is equally as safe as putting your money under the mattress, but at least makes you some money for the future. For most investors, this return is not sufficient to meet their financial goals. But it does set a benchmark, in that any <i>risk-bearing investment</i> must exceed this number to be worthy of consideration.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3"> The next line up represents the return that a lender such as a bank requires from a company in order to loan it money to help fund its operations. This has higher risk than a bond because the company may default on the loan. But it has lower risk than stock investment because it is secured by collateral. Since investors get no collateral, the returns promised to them have to exceed this number as well to be viable.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3"> The next line represents the minimum risk-adjusted return at which it makes sense for an investor to put money into this company. Below this line they get a bad deal. Above this line they get a good deal. This is the real baseline against which company performance is measured. In other words, investors give a company no credit for achieving returns until after they exceed this level. If the company does exceed this number, its stock price starts to get bid up. If it falls below, or looks like it will in the future, its stock price gets bid down. That's why we use this line as the baseline for the CAP chart proper.</font></td>
