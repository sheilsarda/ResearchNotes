  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">In an attempt to reassert architectural control, U.S. Robotics in 1997 has challenged the entire modem industry to a standards war over the future architecture of 56 kbps modems, all in an effort to convert itself from king to gorilla. We will have more to say about this in the final chapter of this book. For now, it is enough to note that everyone else in the market is shocked and appalled that U.S. Robotics would even consider such a thingwhich normally means they wish they had thought of the idea first.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3"> <i>Prince. </i>A market challenger, or potentially a coleader of a market that has no definable king. Typically this company has around 10% to 15% market share. Hewlett-Packard is a good example of a prince in the PC market overall. It was able to attack Compaq's 33% market share in the server market and come into a tie for second with IBM at 19% each. It then attacked the PC desktop market, leveraging its printer divisions' clout with the resellers, and accelerated from nowhere into the top five. But again, if next year they were to fall out of the top ten, the only people who would really notice would be HP shareholders and employees.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Dell Computer, which arguably is the most exciting player in the PC market in 1997, is also a prince. It is using distribution excellence to change the dynamics of competition, but it has no opportunity to put in place architectural barriers to entry or to create high switching costs. It is thus forever engaged in an execution-based competition.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Princes make an interesting contrast to chimps: On the downside, they have no proprietary barriers to entry to keep competitors at bay; on the upside, their competitors, even if they are kings, have no barriers to prevent the princes from attacking them. Additionally, unlike the category of chimp, the category of prince permits aggressive merging. Chimps do not merge well because their mutually incompatible architectures undermine the synergy intended by the merger. HP and Apollo's Unix workstation merger, for example, was unable to unseat Sun. But princes who operate under the same architecture standards can aggregate far more effectively. We have yet to see a prince-to-prince merger of any substance in the PC industrythe Packard Bell to NEC merger appears to have been an abortive trybut the king/prince/serf model predicts that we ought to.</font></td>
