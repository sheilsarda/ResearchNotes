  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">But in high tech, switching costs are exceptionally high, for two reasons. First, the interdependency of systems can be so complex that wholesale switching is simply not an option. And second, because high-tech systems become obsolete so fast, taking time to switch from one to another eats into the total time that one could benefit from the new offer, thus reducing its attractiveness. In short, the pain of switching is rarely offset by the gain, and most switches are driven by involuntary forces, such as the Year 2000 problem, rather than any desire to explore greener pastures. So the gorilla, who has the most to gain from the market not switching, has a whole lot of environmental support. This pays off for investors, because if you have the English Channel protecting your island, you don't have to spend a lot of money on building a Great Wall.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3"> <i>Driving costs down. </i>The fundamental way to drive costs down historically has been economies of scale. The more you buy or make, the more units you can spread your fixed costs over, the less per unit. That's true in any market. But high tech has a way to make that sort of saving look like chicken feed. How about this deal instead: <i>Want something but it is too expensive? Make somebody else pay for it!</i> That is routine for a gorilla. Here's how it works.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">In a value chain, the cost of the total solution is spread over all the companies participating in the chain, but the relationship between cost and value is not constant. Some parts of the offer have low cost and high value, others just the opposite. All are necessary to the total offer's success, so none can be eliminated. But what if you can confine your offers to just the low-cost, high-value ones? That is precisely what a gorilla can and does do.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Gorillas carve out the sweet spot from the value chains they dominate and leave the scraps to the partners. When the customer demands some high-cost, low-value enhancement, the gorilla makes sure that the burden falls on someone else, not them. They outsource, in other words, the low-value work. If the partner doesn't like it, they are free to leave. There is always someone else to take their place. And if a partner or competitor tries to preempt the gorilla's claim on the high-value stuff, the gorilla can always change the standards on them to throw them off balance.</font></td>
