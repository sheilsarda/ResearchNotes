Indeed, when it comes to sophisticated investors reviewing our work, the comment we would be most gratified to hear is, "Well, duuuhhh!"</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">The fact is, however, many people who need to investand indeed are investing todayare not all that sophisticated when it comes to understanding the stock market. Lacking an understanding of its dynamics, they have no formal basis for knowing when to sell or when to buy. We believe this can be extremely dangerous, and our intent is to use Chapter 4 of this book to change all that. It is not an easy chapter to read, and you may have to read it twice, but surely that's a lot better than being thrown back into your nightmare exam, or worse still, setting out to provide for your family's future with an incomplete understanding.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">To give you a head start: The stock price of any company is based on the <i>present value</i> of all its <i>anticipated future earnings</i>. A share in the company is simply a share of its future profits. Any buying or selling of shares requires the buyer and seller to come to an agreement as to that value. The stock market is nothing more than the accumulation of a whole lot of those agreements, and a company's stock price represents the current point of equilibrium between those who would take it higher and those who would take it lower. The company's total value is simply its stock price, or price per share, times the number of shares outstanding, or what is called its market capitalization, or just <i>market cap</i> for short.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">What will be obvious by the end of Chapter 4 is that the market caps of companies selling into an emerging market that is just entering hypergrowth are going to be much higher in relation to their annual revenues than those of companies selling into more mature marketplaces. That's because there is a brand new pile of money out there just waiting to be spent, and people are in a rush to spend it, and there are only a few companies with whom they can spend it.
