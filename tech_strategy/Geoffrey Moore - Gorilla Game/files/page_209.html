  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Even when Cisco began to take on corporate customers, their market was still pre-chasm. It was the visionaries, not the pragmatists, who were in command. One of Cisco's first corporate customers, for example, was Boeing. Their first application was simply an HP 3000 to 9000 link. But then they hooked that up to the Internet. And then they scaled that up to one of the first corporate intranets. At the end of the day, the company had undertaken nothing less than to create a seamless corporate-wide network in support of a massive reengineering of the business processes involved in designing and manufacturing its airplanes. In the process it too had discovered just how many disparate computer systems had found their way into its corridors. And in its search for a solution, it too had found Cisco, not the other way around.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">As work at Boeing and other early customers resulted in demonstrable success in tackling a truly thorny problem, corporate demand started to pick up elsewhere. Word-of-mouth endorsement of Cisco's industrial-strength approach began to spread among the pragmatists who ran the bulk of industry's networks. In addition, it was becoming clear that Cisco could service and support demanding corporate clients, a key skill needed to expand the market to pragmatist users. Business began to take off.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Cisco went public on April 20, 1990. Its original market capitalization was roughly $300 million, well under 1% of its market cap a scant seven years later. Table 9.1 shows quarterly revenue for the emerging router market for the five quarters before the company went public. As the table shows, Cisco accounted for roughly 85% of the market for network routers. Wellfleet Communications, still a private company at the time and one of the predecessor companies to Bay Networks, accounted for the other 15% of the market. Despite several attempts by other vendors to wrest this router market away from Cisco, its market share has remained in the mid-80% through 1997.</font></td>
