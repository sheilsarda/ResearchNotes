  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">dors got established to address the need for increased network bandwidth, and the product category they brought into existence was called <i>LAN switchesLAN</i> for local area network and <i>switches</i> for the ability to switch traffic from point to point. The word <i>switch</i> comes from the telephone industry, where every call is a point-to-point connection. By contrast, in Ethernet networks, every communication is on a party line, sharing the bandwidth with all the other calls on the line. By implementing a switched architecture, network managers would be able to relieve some of the congestion, giving high-volume traffic its own routes and leaving the byways free for the more typical user.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">It turned out that the easiest place to put these LAN switches was right behind the intelligent hubs. From this vantage they could segment and route however demand dictated. But it soon became clear not only that there was a fair amount of duplication in this arrangement, but that replacing the intelligent hub altogether would increase the bandwidth even more dramatically. Thus if you were going to implement switches, you would probably do so at the expense of hubs. Nonetheless, at the beginning the two markets coexisted nicely because making any change to network architecture risked disruptions that few companies wanted to entertain. Over time, however, as network administrators became more comfortable with the transition of LAN switches replacing intelligent hubs, the market for LAN switches began to accelerate.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">The market for LAN switches was pioneered predominantly by new, smaller networking vendors such as Kalpana, Synernetics, ALANTEC, Crescendo, Network Peripherals, and Grand Junction, all of which were privately held at the outset. Although LAN switches would eventually displace intelligent hubs in many, if not most, corporate networks, the initial market development was similar to other technology markets. The initial buyers were corporations with acute and specific bandwidth needs. LAN switches offer enormous increases in bandwidth, but required their own understanding, and sometimes a new network architecture. The early users were the ones with the most painthey would be the most tolerant of the high costs of purchasing and supporting a whole new category of device. As the new vendors became more sophisticated in dealing with corporations, however, and as the devices themselves became more bug-free, demand began to accelerate to other corporations and more pragmatic users.</font></td>
