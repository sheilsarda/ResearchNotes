  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">This could easily be the title for a movie about the history of IBM's OS/2 operating system for PCs. IBM never realized that it was playing a chimp role. It had spent too much money on OS/2, and by God it had invented the PC, and no upstart West Coast bespectacled little twerp was going to take it away from them. The problem was, they weren't fighting Bill Gates. They were fighting every PC application company that had swung over to Windows, every information systems (IS) director who had finally decided to commit to Windows, every peripheral manufacturer who found in Windows a solution to the escalating cost of writing multiple device drivers for multiple applicationsin short, they were fighting the very marketplace they had fostered. It had turned on them, and they, who had always held proprietary control over their customer and partner bases in the past, had no frame of reference to understand the dynamic. As such, they continued up until as recently as the first half of 1996 to launch repeated attacks against Windows, advocating OS/2 as the better choice. To realize how impossible that choice really is, just ask yourself how much money would have to be spent today to reengineer Windows out of the marketplace. (Answer: about as much as it would take to convert to driving on the other side of the road.) There is not that much money on the planet. It is not called the Wintel standard for nothing.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">So chimps must never attack gorillasat least not directly. Instead, their correct response is to take the second alternative noted aboveto focus on niche markets whose special needs are being ignored by the gorilla's mass market approach, to enter and dominate those niches as rapidly as possible. Here the liability of a nonstandard architecture is more than overcome by the added value of making special commitments to the niche's unique needs. At the same time, chimps can continue to compete aggressively for new customers in the general mass market, playing the role of a kinder, gentler vendor. There are always mass market prospects who get alienated by the gorilla's high-priced arrogant ways and become angry enough to override their pragmatist bias toward the safe buy.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Overall, in a tornado market the chimp's goal should be to build a respectable market shareideally a number two position in the mass market anchored by niches of customers within which they are number one.
