  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Building out systems infrastructure is hugely expensive, as the business plans for any of these companies make painfully clear. You have to charge a lot of transaction fees for a very long time to even approximate it. Historically, most successful transaction services franchises come into being on the back of publicly funded, not privately funded, infrastructure. The original Internet itself represents such a publicly funded entity. But now the commercialization and scaling up of the Internet is being funded privately, at potentially ruinous costs. It is not clear that this model can ever pay its investors back. So that is strike one.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Strike two is getting the revenues. Where will they come from? Subscription fees, we have already discovered, are not enough. Consumers and business customers alike are too price-sensitive. For a while we thought transaction-processing fees would be the source, but the volume of transactions that one could charge a fee for is still very low in the Internet space. Maybe someday. Charging for information is a third possibility, and maybe someday it too will come through, but for now there is so much free information on the Internet that paid-for info is being shunted aside. All this clears the way for the current knight on white horseadvertising. Internet sites, most business plans now assume, will act like TV channelsthey will attract viewers, and these viewers' eyeballs can be sold to advertisers.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Let's assume that this model stabilizes. (Please note, however, that it hasn't yet, so investors should garner a higher risk-adjusted premium for going forward.) Now the problem is to get the costs under the revenues. Again, there are all kinds of ideas about how this might be done, but little track record to date to show that it has been done. Indeed, the press repeatedly calls attention to the fact that the best-known sites are as yet unprofitable. Moreover, there are whole industries, like the airline industry, that appear to be constitutionally unprofitable. There is no guarantee, in other words, that this model will ever work. So that is strike two.</font></td>
