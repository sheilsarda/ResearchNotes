  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">At the bottom of the middle, if you will bear with us, is the <i>operating system</i>. It manages all the interactions between the hardware and the rest of the software. It contains within it a file management system, but for storing and retrieving complex data used by many different applications, the industry looks to <i>database</i> software. To write the applications that use the system there is a whole other class of software called <i>tools and languages</i>, typically very specialized but sometimes becoming highly visible, as is the case with Java.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">This leaves two final areas, both of which have become problem-atic in recent years. The first of these is <i>networking software</i>, which manages the connections of one computer to another, something that used to be a subset of the operating systems responsibility, but is increasingly coming under the domain of the networking hardware vendors. This puts operating systems and networking hardware vendors on a collision course, setting up what could be the gorilla collision of all time between Microsoft and Cisco.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">The other area is <i>middleware</i>. This really is glue, the category being a catchall for highly useful software that has yet to be legitimized into its own category. The rise of networked computing has created huge needs in the middleware space, so we will be seeing lots more of this stuff, but the marketplace has no easy way of processing it. The problem is that middleware, by its very nature, is intimately connected with all the other types of system software and thus encroaches on all the established fiefdoms in the marketplace. In order to gain power, the category must break free from the others. But since it takes a specialist to understand what exactly the middleware is doing, and since specialists are known to disagree, it is virtually impossible to get clarity on this stuff. Most middleware comes to prominence only after it has been acquired or absorbed by an established player in some other category of system software; so despite all the tornado winds blowing around the category, it is typically not a candidate for the gorilla game.</font></td>
