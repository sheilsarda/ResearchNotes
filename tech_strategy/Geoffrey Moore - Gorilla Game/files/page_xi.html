Together, they helped keep things under control during the entire project, performed heroic feats of cross-platform manuscript management, and lied cheerfully as to our whereabouts on an as-needed basis. Only authors know how much this kind of support means, and we are profoundly grateful for it.</font></td>

In addition she was his number one fan while writing this book, and proactively provided whatever was required to keep him writing and moving ahead. Whether he needed motivational support after a long weekend of writing and researching, good strong coffee at 2 AM, conversation with someone about an idea, or laughs to lighten things up, she was there.</font></td>

There is no one on the planet whose ideas he is more interested in or who has had a deeper impact on his thinking and on the kind of person he is trying to be. It is her energy passing through him that makes whatever success he enjoys possible.</font></td>
