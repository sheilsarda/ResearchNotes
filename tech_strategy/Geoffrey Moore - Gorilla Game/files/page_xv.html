  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">The chasm/tornado framework has gained broad acceptance within the high-tech industry. Both of Moore's books are featured in graduate school curricula at Harvard, MIT, Stanford, and other leading schools of business and engineering. Venture funds such as Institutional Venture Partners, The Mayfield Fund, Atlas Ventures, and Mohr Davidow have made them required reading for every one of their portfolio companies' management teams. They are also standard reading for the executives at Cisco, Hewlett Packard, Microsoft, SAP, and Digital Equipment Corporation. All this, in turn, has led to consulting engagements for The Chasm Group with these and a host of other Fortune 500 technology companies, as well as with numerous start-ups and small-cap companies that intend to become the next generation of high-tech leaders. The end result is a wealth of experience about the dynamics of competitive advantage in high-tech markets which has helped form the basis for this book.</font></td>

He has teamed up with Geoff and Tom to help convert their business strategy framework into a framework for an investment practice. Paul's credentials took a big step forward when in 1990 he was the first analyst on Wall Street to write a BUY report for Cisco Systems. Since then he has been the one who has made the first call to buy Cabletron, Ascend, and Pairgain, and more generally, the one who first outlined the consolidation trend in the networking sector and explained what it meant.</font></td>
