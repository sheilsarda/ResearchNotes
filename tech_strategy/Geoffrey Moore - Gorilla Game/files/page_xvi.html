  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Meanwhile, while Geoff and Paul were busy teaching and writing, Tom Kippola and various members of his family with whom he co-invests were just quietly amassing wealth. (Geoff and Paul know there is a lesson in this somewhere, but they are still struggling to grasp it.) Tom had intuitively come up with the rudiments of the gorilla game without any of the underlying theory and began practicing it the day in 1990 when he finally convinced his dad to put $7,000 into Oracle. In the following year Tom and various other members of his family acting on his advice put similar amounts of money into Microsoft, Intel, and Novell, and a couple of years after that into Cisco Systems and Bay Networks. More recently they have been focused on customer support and sales force automation software, as Tom will discuss in Chapter 8. But in the space of seven years they have taken nest-eggs totaling less than $100,000 and turned them into the better part of $1 million, and in the process learned many of the hard-won lessons that are shared in this book. In parallel with this, Tom joined The Chasm Group in 1994 and has subsequently become its managing partner.</font></td>
