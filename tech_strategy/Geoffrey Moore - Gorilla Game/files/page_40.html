Other vendors may subsequently make attractive offers, but the thought of all the work that switching would take will deter the customer from accepting them. This means that whichever vendor the customer starts with is very likely to be the one it stays with. And the same sort of forces operate on business partners. Once one company gets something successful going with another company, there is an inertia that resists further change.</font></td>

The basic business rule here is that you gain or lose a customer in the tornadofor life! The only company whose market-share increases going forward is the gorilla. This happens because as weaker companies fall out of the market, their customers are forced to seek a new vendor, and having been once burned by not going with the market leader, they now intend to rectify that mistake once and for all.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Even when the life of a product category extends decades beyond the tornado that proliferated it, the market-share patterns established during the tornado are the ones that persist. IBM will always be the leader in mainframe computers, just as General Motors has always been the leader in the automotive industry, and Boeing in aerospace, and AT&amp;T in telecommunications. In these cases, to be sure, the outline of the tornado persists faintly, like the geologic residue of some long-ago tectonic shift. Gorilla power has been worn down, and in fact many historic gorillas have grown fat and lazy. But do not let that mislead you as to the reality or intensity of gorilla advantage. Just because some companies have frittered it away does not mean that the power itself is transitory. In Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, and Oracle, the world is meeting a new breed of gorilla whose appetite for growth and power appears to be insatiable. For such companies, extending the life of the product category simply extends the period of their competitive advantage as the gorilla. It is the reason we advocate not just <i>buying</i> gorilla stocks, but <i>holding</i> them.</font></td>
