  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">The market position of Intel's architecture ensures that the competitive advantage within category is long-lived. This frees Intel from the pressures of chimp competition. It does not free it, however, from the pressure of monkey competition. AMD and National Semiconductor, with its acquisition of Cyrix, both have successful cloning efforts under way. These challenge Intel's margins and force it to compete more like a king and less like a gorilla than it would like to. However, it is all a matter of degree. The company still has massive market share advantage and still secures premium margins for its latest products.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">What has been so miraculous about Intel has been its ability to <i>extend</i> its de facto standard advantage. Intel has leveraged its original 8088/8086 CPU line into a series of very successful generations of CPUs, starting with the 80286 in the mid-1980s and continuing with the 80386, 80486, Pentium, Pentium Pro, and Pentium II. Each of these generations has gone through its own tornado, one after another in a carefully managed sequence, so that just as one was nearing the end of its tornado, the next was just beginning. This "scheduling of tornadoes" has enabled Intel to stay in what seems like a perpetual tornado, a recurrent and seemingly stable condition of perpetual hypergrowth. And before the end of the century, its next-generation microprocessor, codeveloped with Hewlett-Packard, is expected to continue Intel's streak.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Intel's leverage, however, does not just extend into successive generations of higher performance CPUs. It also extends into subsuming the functionality of other kinds of chips. The motherboard of a PCthe main circuit boardis made up of the Intel CPU plus dozens of other supporting chips designed and manufactured by various other chip manufacturers. Each successive generation of Intel CPU, however, has eliminated the need for some of those supporting chips by including their functionality right into the CPU. In the move from the 80386 to the 80486, for example, Intel incorporated floating point processing into the main CPU, thereby taking those dollars away from competitors' offerings. And more recently, it has made the same sort of assault on graphics coprocessors.</font></td>
