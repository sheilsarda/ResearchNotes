  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">None of this could have been accomplished without the emergence of an entirely new category of computer system called <i>networking hardware</i>. Not surprisingly, the category as a whole has created enormous wealth for investors during this decade, and no one has profited more than those who bought stock in Cisco Systems. From the time it went public in April 1990 until June 1997, Cisco's stock has appreciated by more than a hundredfold.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Cisco is a classic Silicon Valley success story. Founded by five techies from Stanford University, almost literally in a garage, the company went on to dominate the $15 billion market for data networking equipment in less than a decade. In June 1992 Cisco's revenues were essentially equivalent to those of rival Bay Networks, each with quarterly revenues of roughly $110 million. (The Bay Networks figure actually represents the sum of SynOptics and Wellfleet, who were later to merge to form Bay.) By mid-1997, five years later, Cisco's revenues had grown to be approximately three and a half times the size of Bay's. Please note that Bay's performance has hardly been a stumble: Its revenues had been growing by more than 30% per year during this period and its stock went up more than sixteen-fold from its IPO. But in the same five years, Cisco went from accounting for approximately 15% of the industry's profits to nearly 50%. As we have said repeatedly, differences of this magnitude cannot be explained by better management, strategy, or execution. Instead, they reflect the fundamental dynamics of the tornado, and there remains little doubt that Cisco has emerged as the gorilla of networking hardware.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">The company was formed in 1984 by five engineers: The two most visible were Sandra Lerner and Len Bosack, who lived together and both worked at Stanford University. Lerner was in the business school and Bosack was in the computer science department. Although they worked on the same university campus, they could not send each other e-mail because of the disparate computer networks that each department had implemented. The business school ran on an HP 3000, while the engineering school ran on an HP 9000. Despite the fact that both computers came from the same company, the machines could not interoperate within a network. This was not an unusual state of affairs during the 1980s, for in most computer companies,</font></td>
