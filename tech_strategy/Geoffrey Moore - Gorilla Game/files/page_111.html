  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">To read the chart, start with the heavy black curve that bounds the white space. This represents the market's current expectations for returns and CAP. Now let's suppose the company surprises with upside returns. The market puts those into its recalculation of the net present value of the firm, but it does not change its CAP. This creates the shaded area above the white space, the additional economic value added expected from future returns. But why no new CAP? Because the news came as a surprise, and the market has no information that the competitive dynamics in the category have changed. So while the upside surprise does increase the company's market capitalization, the additional amount is relatively modest.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">By contrast, if the company surprises with downside returns, the market not only subtracts them on the vertical axis, reducing the formula for return, but it also clips the horizontal axis as well. In other words, this time it <i>does</i> change CAP. Why this time? Because the company did not warn it! The reaction here may not be conscious, but it is wise, for in the absence of any warning, there is a good chance the company has encountered an unexpected change in its competitive position and reacted by simply denying it.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">This is not as uncommon as it might seem. No management team voluntarily admits to any condition that will lower its stock price. All teams keep struggling to keep the price up. This means that for several quarters they pull out all their stops to hit their numbers, often doing so by pulling in business from future quarters to make the current quarter fit what "the Street" expects. So when the team finally does fail to hit their numbers, it often means that their competitive position has severely eroded, and thus their CAP should be adjusted downward dramatically.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">When the market lowers its expectations of returns and foreshortens the CAP at the same time, it is punishment indeed. Look how much area under the curve is lost! It is typical for a high-tech company at such a junctureeven a gorillato lose a third or more of its market capitalization in a single day! This, in turn, almost always attracts shareholder lawsuits, because surely such a collapse could only be the result of fraud. In fact, it is normally not fraud at all, but simply the fearsome dynamics of tornado markets at work.</font></td>
