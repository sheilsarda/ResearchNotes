The promise each year was both specific and unvarying: I'll give you another $15 if I get to hold on to your $100 for another year. That works for a loan or a bond, but not for a company. Its promise is much less specific and much more variable. The truth is, management does not know how much they are going to return. All they can do is forecast to the best of their ability and make that forecast available to investors as input. They can, in other words, <i>set expectations</i>.</font></td>

Based on these expectations, they may decide to bid for a share of this management team's future operating profits. The amount of that bid is a direct reflection of their estimate of the net present value of the share they would get of those future profits (whether they know it or not).</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">To actually buy a share, of course, there must be a seller as well as a buyer. If the bid is accepted, that means that someone else thinks the net present value is less than or equal to the price offered. The seller in other words has a different set of expectations. On an individual basis, the seller's motive could be almost anything. Maybe they "know" the company is going to tank. Maybe they just want to get their money out to buy a house. Who knows? But on an aggregate basis, in a market where there are many buyers and many sellers, individual motives cancel out. The system instead operates more like the laws of chemistry and physicsit seeks an equilibrium point where the expectations of buyers and sellers converge.</font></td>
