  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">another, each time <i>anyone</i> introduced a new product, it created additional complexity for <i>everyone's</i> support desks. The demands on hardware and software vendor support centers rose geometrically. Companies first attacked this problem by hiring additional people to staff their support desks. Then they began to run out of qualified people, so they began hiring less-qualified people and training them. However, that didn't solve the problem either. It was not uncommon for an end user to call a support center and wait on hold for an hour before getting through to a support representative.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">This <i>broken, mission-critical business process</i> is the primary market driver needed for crossing the chasm and starting a bowling alley market. Customer support departments sponsored the arrival of client/server customer support applications. If only one vendor had answered the call, that vendor would now be the gorilla in the space. But three vendorsClarify, Scopus, and Vantiveall answered at roughly the same time. All three produced excellent software, all entered the market simultaneously, and thus no one company was able to gain an SAP-like dominance over the other two. In the micro-tornado of the first segment, which should have produced a micro-gorillathat is, a definitive market leader for that segmentthe result instead was three micro-chimps. Now, because the category has been so explosive, and because it clearly has opportunities to expand far beyond its initial niche, being a micro-chimp is not all that bad. But it is an unstable condition, and the market is watching closely to see what happens next.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Markets seek hierarchies if for no other reason than to speed purchase decisions. If there is no clear leader, then customer after customer feels compelled to go through lengthy evaluations and benchmarks. It drives everyone nuts, not only the vendors themselves but also their partners who are waiting on this decision in order to get their bids approved. So we expect the broad market to resolve itself into the more familiar gorilla/chimp 1/chimp 2 pattern over time. It is therefore, in our view, a gorilla game in progress. The questions now are, how would gorilla-game investors have learned about it, when would they have acted and on what information, and what would be the status of those actions as of September 1997?</font></td>
