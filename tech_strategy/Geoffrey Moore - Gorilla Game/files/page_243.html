  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Client/server applications participate in what is arguably the fourth wave of computing since the computer industry's inception. The first wave was mainframe-based and focused on automating mission-critical business processes for large corporations and organizations, largely through the streamlining of records and calculations. Its primary beneficiary was the finance and accounting department, although over time these applications branched out into order entry, inventory, manufacturing, and distribution. The second wave came with the rise of the minicomputer. Computing was brought into the design and engineering functions and down onto the factory floor. At the same time, minicomputer-based word processing systems were beginning to have an impact in sales and consulting functions. Finally, smaller companies and divisions of larger companies were getting their own dedicated versions of what had heretofore been mainframe applications. Then a third wave came along, led by the PC, which completely reengineered the way individuals and workgroups interacted with information and each other. Applications here were highly standardized, requiring much less support and training, and thus easy to proliferate. Whereas today there are tens of thousands of mainframes, and hundreds of thousands of minicomputers, there are tens of millions of PCs.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">At the end of the third wave, the world was heavily populated with computers of all shapes and sizes, none of which talked to each other very well. Industry analysts began to describe large-company computing infrastructures as "islands of automation." By 1990 it was clear to most companies that if all their different types of computers were supposed to interoperate with one another, a new computing model was needed as the enabler. Thus began the emergence of <i>client/server</i> computing as the fourth distinct wave of computing.</font></td>
