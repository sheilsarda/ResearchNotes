  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">This interoperability actually helps speed market development; hence, the much quicker arrival of the intelligent hub tornado compared to the router. But from the gorilla-game investor's point of view, the lack of proprietary architectural control means that no one company can dominate the market the way a gorilla can. While all these stocks appreciated, two of them breaking the 10x barrier at least for a time, none of them has gorilla power, and therefore they do not end up qualifying as long-term holds for the gorilla game.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">While Cisco did not play in the intelligent hub market directly, the growth of the intelligent hub market contributed indirectly to its success. As hubs increased the density of network traffic, it became necessary to use routers in large networks simply as traffic cops to try to manage the ever increasing load placed on the backbone of the network. By segmenting large networks into smaller workgroups, and using routers to communicate between workgroup segments and the backbone, corporations could continue to scale their networks. Therefore, the growth of the intelligent hub market, and the number of workgroup networks by implication, further fueled Cisco's routing tornado.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">In addition, Cisco developed a comarketing program with the three largest vendors of intelligent hubs: SynOptics, Cabletron, and Chipcom. Because corporations usually decided on an intelligent hub vendor before choosing a router vendor, these relations were extremely important to Cisco's continued success. Through this program, as corporations were making their selection of a router vendor, Cisco ensured that all of these vendors referenced their relationship with Cisco. Indeed, at one point Cisco and SynOptics looked at a sustained partnership, but as the industry forces trended toward consolidation, it became clear to both companies that theirs was to be a competitive relationship instead. In fact, that realization was one of the driving forces behind SynOptics' merger with Wellfleet, combining the number one intelligent hub company with the number two router company to create Bay Networks.</font></td>
