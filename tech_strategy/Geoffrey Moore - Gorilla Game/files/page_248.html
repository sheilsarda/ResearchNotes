  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Here is where Oracle, PeopleSoft, and Baan all seek to reassert their own market leadership. At the same time, going further downmarket, PC-based applications from vendors like Great Plains and others are now scaling up into the client/server space, leveraging the increasingly sophisticated Windows NT environment. And between these two endpoints are any number of intermediate strategies from companies like J.D. Edwards, Lawson, Platinum, SSA, and others, intended to carve out chunks of the middle-tier market using a vertical market focus. The net of all these approaches to date has simply been to provide customers with an attractive variety of choices, there being enough available market for most well-executed plans. But going forward, as this space becomes increasingly crowded, the issue of which of these companies can build sustainable competitive advantage will drive stock performance. Once again, there will be a direct parallel to this competition in the front office space.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Prior to client/server computing, the front office applications space had never made it to the tornadoin fact, it's arguable that it never crossed the chasm. While a number of large companies had installed customer service automation systems, or sales force automation systems, the offerings were typically custom-built from scratch. A few companies, such as Brock Systems, did offer prepackaged SFA applications, but the category never took off, in part because the laptop computer infrastructure was not really robust enough to support it, and in part because automating salespeople is a bit like herding cats.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">From the early to the mid-1990s a number of factors changed the front office application landscape forever. The pressure came not from sales, however, but from service. The incredible success of the computer industry had created a huge headache. As the computer industry pumped out an ever-rising volume of products, the number of support calls to computer industry support centers rose astronomically.
