Although the revenues generated from LAN switching were still small, most industry observers believed that LAN switching would play a major role in the future of the networking industry.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">On that day Cisco Systems, the gorilla in network routers, announced the acquisition of Crescendo Communications, a privately held networking vendor specializing in LAN switches. Although Crescendo was neither the largest nor the most important of the LAN switch vendors, this announcement sent a shock wave through the industry. At the time of the acquisition, Cisco dominated the market for network routers, and the company was now endorsing the market for switching. Although the LAN switch market had not yet entered its tornado, Cisco's endorsement was a critical catalyst to accelerating market acceptance of these products and technologies. Thus by the time the tornado started, Cisco was the only publicly traded equity that would allow the private investor to play in the LAN switch game.</font></td>
