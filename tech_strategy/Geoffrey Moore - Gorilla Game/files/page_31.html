  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">That is, to win over their target segments, each of these product vendors has to commit not just to providing an excellent product, but also to fielding a complete suite of products and services to solve the entire problem for the target segment. This leads them to recruit other companies that have the necessary competencies they lack, thereby forging a whole new value chain where none existed before. Once such a team is formed and the market has rallied around its solution, all other vendors get summarily excluded from the segment (pragmatists like to standardize on a single solution once they find one that works); so these first movers get to enjoy the fruits of market leadership for a long time to come.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">It is this capability to support <i>a new value chain's formation</i> that makes the bowling alley so strategic to the gorilla-game investor. It is literally a new marketplace coming into being. It is the way that mainstream markets "accommodate" a discontinuous innovation. The reward for every company in this new marketplace's value chain is the opportunity to grow with virtually no competition from well-established incumbent vendors. The bowling alley stage is thus the earliest moment that a high-tech company can truly define itself as a going concern, because for the first time it has committed customers and a protected marketplace to support it in the years to come. As you will see in later chapters, it is also the earliest investable moment in the gorilla game. But we are not yet in a gorilla game proper, because there is not yet a mass market phenomenon. These companies can all look forward to growth, but not yet to hypergrowth. Here's why.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">The reason niche markets are called the "bowling alley" is that ongoing market growth will be niche to niche, each entry into a new niche being eased by leveraging the prior niche's solution set and reference base of customers. By this mechanism companies can continue to grow their marketplace in advance of gaining widespread mass market support. Each new niche creates a moment of "micro-hypergrowth," as all the pragmatists in that niche follow the micro-herd to adopt the new technology. But it does not create "macro-hypergrowth''that is what happens when entire mass markets adopt the stuff from which true gorillas are made. For that to occur the market must transition to the tornado.</font></td>
