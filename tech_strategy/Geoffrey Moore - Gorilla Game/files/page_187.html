  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">At this point relational databases entered the scene. Their claim was that they could support both OLTP and DSS from a single product. Initially, performance was so slow on the OLTP side that only laboratory and other low-volume-transaction applications were viable, but over time performance improved to the point where commercial OLTP was an option. On the decision support side, the products competed against a host of other fourth-generation languages, but gained a huge boost when Oracle standardized on IBM's SQL language. Almost overnight, this created a de facto standard for the category.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Now, IBM had the mainframe business locked up, and that was where it focused its SQL efforts via a product called DB2. It also had a strong minicomputer in the AS/400, but it did not use an SQL-oriented system, so IBM had no interest in SQL databases on minicomputers or, as it later turned out, on PCs. This left the field wide open for the relational database companies. Oracle, in particular, made its cause <i>portability</i>, porting its system to every viable platform in the market. Since every minicomputer needed a whole product, and since they all were focused on hardware rather than software, they welcomed Oracle's efforts and gave them full support (indeed, most even paid the company to port).</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">When Informix entered this market, it was already behind Oracle in size and market presence, but it saw an opportunity that Oracle did not, namely, the exploitation of the Unix market. At the time, this was not much of a market, its top offer being back office systems for dentists and doctors, based on microcomputer servers from companies like Altos, running a version of Unix from the Santa Cruz Operation, and being sold and serviced through small value-added resellers. Later on, however, it would turn out that Informix's focus on this technology was prescient.</font></td>
