  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">With relational databases locked in, once again we can look to buy the basket or go with the old gorilla. As before, there were two attractive alternatives to Oracle, both of which had successfully marketed differentiated solutions that would be hard for Oracle to match. One of these was our old friend Informix who, under the leadership of Phil White, had pulled itself together after the merger with Innovative, streamlined its operations, and set about exploiting its Unix position in the market. By the last quarter of 1990, it was garnering this sort of comment from <i>Computerworld</i>: ''Still, Informix's annual growth rate of 20% to 30% is modest compared with . . . industry leader Oracle Systems Corp's . . . rates of 50% or more. <i>Yet, Informix bests Oracle within the Unix marketplace.</i>" (italics added). It would have been the company's superior Unix position that would cause a gorilla-game investor to put it in the basket. This would have been bolstered when in February of 1992 Informix surprised Wall Street with upside earnings and revenuesa performance that would continue for some time to come.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">The other attractive alternative was a newcomer, Sybase, which had withdrawn its public offering in 1990 because of the terrible downturn in the sector, and gone public in 1991 instead. Sybase had taken advantage of RTI's fall from grace and Informix's struggles to leapfrog them both into second place in the relational database market. Moreover, it had done so specifically with the message of <i>client/server database</i>. Its growth rates were higher than either of its competitors, and it was the darling of Wall Street, which just happened to be the head bowling pin in its "crossing the chasm" strategy. As the world moved to client/server architecture, it looked like Sybase could come out the winner, and for the next three years it would outperform the category.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Neither of these competitors, however, had anything like Oracle's size, so you would have had no qualms about keeping the Oracle position in your portfolio strong. By mid-1992 Oracle too was surprising the Street with "robust" sales and "surging" earnings, to use the adjectives that <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> loves to employ. Let us suppose, then, that you added the other two, and because you were still licking your 1990 wounds a bit, did nothing to change your</font></td>
