  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Although there were local successes with this first generation of systems, the overall market penetration was not impressive. First of all, in the absence of a mature client/server infrastructure, there were enough systems problems that many end users never really got comfortable with the new application. Second, it turned out that having the system running during a face-to-face meeting with a prospect was not in the cards, so the promised win for the sales force was not as great as originally conceived. Third, many highly successful sales people have personalities that resist structured processes, and these folks rebelled against the system and put peer pressure on their colleagues to reject it as well. Finally, in light of all the foregoing, overall end-user adoption was spotty and compliance was mediocre, which in turn made it impossible to deliver on the promise of timely, reliable sales forecasts.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">This led some SFA vendors to retrench back into niche markets, a notable success being Sales Technologies, which focused intensely on the pharmaceutical marketplace. By so doing they targeted a specific sales cycle where having a huge amount of technical information on a laptop was actually useful during the sales call. Moreover, field teams were able to target sales programs more effectively with additional data about who was writing what prescriptions. But when the SFA industry tried to generalize this model to the computer industry, which also has a knowledge-intensive sales cycle, it fizzled. It turned out that the person carrying the knowledge in the laptop was not the sales executive, but the systems engineer. This outcome was fine for the laptop companiesthey still sold their computersbut not for the SFA software companies.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">The increasing maturity of client/server computing, however, has changed this equation. Now every salesperson carries a laptop, if for no other reason than to do e-mail. And today the infrastructure for logging into the enterprise to get that e-mail has become increasingly reliable, straightforward, and speedy. Also, today's laptops have CD-ROM capability for carrying large data files and presentation images,</font></td>
