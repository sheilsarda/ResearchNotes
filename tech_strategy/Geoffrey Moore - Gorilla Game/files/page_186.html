  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">The category of relational databases emerged in the early 1980s. It was an outgrowth of the ever increasing need to deal with more and more data across more and more programs, and eventually across more and more computers. The first data management technology had been sequential files on magnetic tape. It was good for long runs of master files being updated with a batch of transactions. It was too cumbersome, however, when you wanted to access or update just a few records in the middle of the tape. Therefore it was supplemented with indexed files on hard disks, which solved the access problems nicely, but led to a huge proliferation of files, many of which had much of the same data inside them.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Having multiple copies of the same data leads to one copy getting updated while another is not, which in turn leads to unreliable data values. This led to the invention of a third technology, the database, in which the goal was to have one, and only one, copy of any data element. All programs were directed to a database manager to ''check out and return" the data they needed. This ensured that all programs were working with the correct data, but created a bottleneck, especially in the response time it took for on-line transaction processing (OLTP). Vendors like IBM solved this problem with hierarchical databases that sped up the input transactions dramatically. But as with everything, there were trade-offs. To gain OLTP speed, hierarchical databases sacrificed both ease of use and flexibility in query and reporting.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">When businesses woke up to the fact that computers were not just fast clerks, but were in fact the core of their management information systems, the demand for query and reporting flexibility skyrocketed. This created a demand for yet another class of products, variously called report-writers, decision support systems, or fourth-generation</font></td>
