  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">As more and more customers adopt the innovative technology, the time gap between adopting now and adopting with everyone else begins to shrink. At some point visionaries begin to doubt that the gap is large enough to let them preempt a genuine competitive advantage by going ahead of the herd. They fear, in other words, that some fast follower could catch up with them and weaken their first-mover advantage. At this point in the adoption life cycle, therefore, visionaries start losing interest.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">At this very same time, however, pragmatists are far from ready to take up the mantle of technology adoption. They are still waiting to see if their fellow pragmatists are adopting, and if so, whether they are having any success. Specifically, they are looking for references within their own community who can testify to surviving the plunge. At this point, however, there aren't any such referencesonly the odd visionary whose project is too radical to be representative of what a pragmatic person wants to undertake. So the pragmatists bide their time, perhaps by running a small pilot project, but most likely by just going to seminars to keep abreast of events.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">On the vendor side, however, while the customers are waffling, the competitors are not. The new technology's success in the early market has attracted the attention of the established vendors, who have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. They now unite to expel the intruder, sowing seeds of doubt about the new company's financial viability and ridiculing the immaturity of its product and the incompleteness of its integration. If the innovator cannot secure a market position for itself relatively quickly, it will die in the chasm.</font></td>

  <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">This was the fate of expert systems, pen-based computing, desktop videoconferencing, computer-aided software engineering tools, and neural networks. No longer novel enough for the visionaries to find ongoing competitive advantage potential in them, they remained just discontinuous enough to keep the pragmatists at bay. In most cases, the products lingered on for a while, each year generating more costs than revenues, until finally the companies that sponsored them either dissolved or moved on to other things. In such an event, needless to say, all the money invested was lost.</font></td>
