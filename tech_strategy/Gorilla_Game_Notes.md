## Tornado Theory

- The tornado is a compressed period of hypergrowth that occurs once in the life of a market, coinciding with the first surge of mass market adoption of any new technology. 
- It creates a unique set of marketplace dynamics that frequently will catapult a single company into a position of overwhelmingly dominant competitive advantage. 
- This company becomes the gorilla, and the dominant competitive advantages it enjoys will allow it to generate exceptional returns to its investors for an unusually extended period. 
- The whole thrust of the gorilla game is to build long-term holdings in these gorillas.
- The tornado is the force behind the exponential customer adoption S curves that get drawn over and over again by high-tech market analysts.
- The gorilla architecture is acting something like a reef upon which this new ecosystem has sprung up, and therefore every living thing in the system has a stake in keeping it stable (including the customers).
- The tornado lasts only a few years, perhaps three to five, the time it takes for the initial surge of demand to be absorbed, after which the market reestablishes equilibrium with supply.

## The Bowling Alley

- The bowling alley represents the market penetration phase of the Technology Adoption Life Cycle. It is located at the frontier of the mainstream market, just the other side of the chasm, and represents niches of pragmatist customers who are willing to adopt a new technology ahead of the herd.	
- But how can this be possible, since pragmatists are by definition herd animals? It is made possible by the fact that subsets of pragmatists, united by a common cause, aggregate into ''micro-herds" that move ahead of the main herd. Why? Because they are in pain. They need relief, and the only place they think they can find it is in the new technology.	
- Specifically, bowling alley market segments typically build up around departmental functions whose managers find themselves saddled with what we call a ``broken, mission-critical business process``. 
	- These broken processes are jeopardizing the entire enterprise's ability to serve its customers. 
	- Top management has put these managers on notice to fix the process, or else. 	
- Managers who are under this kind of "broken-process" pressure will sponsor a new technology ahead of the herd, but only if the system provider can commit to an end-to-end solution to their problem.	

## Bowling Alley Forever

- These markets never transform from niche to mass, but just continue along as a series of niches. 
- Such companies can continue to grow for only so long if they never enter into a true mass market. Sooner or later, they run out of new niches.
- This is the pattern that has characterized specialized niche companies like MapInfo and ESRI in geographical information systems, Applied Materials and Lam Research in semiconductor equipment, and Autodesk and Parametric Technology Inc. in mechanical CAD software. 

## Total Assimilation vs End of Life	

- Total assimilation represents the end of the Technology Adoption Life Cyclebut not the end of the product category. 
- Indeed, in most industries the bulk of the revenues and profits of the product category are generated long after the technology has been totally assimilated. Think of cars, televisions, microwave ovens, and the like. 
- The power relationships that will govern the category for the entirety of its Main Street market phase are established during the tornado phase, ``permanently!``

## Gorilla Value Chains

- Gorillas carve out the sweet spot from the value chains they dominate and leave the scraps to the partners. 
- When the customer demands some high-cost, low-value enhancement, the gorilla makes sure that the burden falls on someone else, not them. 
- They outsource, in other words, the low-value work. If the partner doesn't like it, they are free to leave. 
- There is always someone else to take their place. And if a partner or competitor tries to preempt the gorilla's claim on the high-value stuff, the gorilla can always change the standards on them to throw them off balance.
- Gorillas have great products because business partners prioritize complementing the market-leading solution before they put resources into complementing some other offer.

## Gorillas, Chimps and Monkeys

### Monkeys

- Monkeys are simply companies that clone the gorilla architecture and offer products 100%-compatible with the gorilla products at a discount. 
- They do not have permission to change standards, and therefore they cannot create new markets. 
- Moreover, whenever the gorilla makes any change to its de facto standard architecture, monkeys must stop whatever they are doing and reengineer their offers to restore 100% compatibility.

### Chimps

- Chimps are companies that tried to become the gorilla but just didn't get picked. 
- As such they have already invested heavily in their own product architecture, one they had hoped would become the gorilla standard, and one that is thoroughly incompatible with the gorilla's.
- Whereas the monkey has market scale but no barriers to entry, the chimp has barriers to entry but no market scale. 
	- Whatever customers it can win, it can keep, because like the gorilla, it too has proprietary control of an architecture.
	- The chimp is thereby forced to take one of two paths:	
		- Continue its attack on the gorilla in an attempt to wrest mass market control away from it.	
		- Retreat into one or more niche markets to become a "local gorilla" inside the niche.

## Kings, Princes and Serfs

Markets that have the "royalty structure" of king/prince/serf, as opposed to the "primate structure" of gorilla/chimp/monkey, pose an ambiguous challenge to the gorilla-game investor.

### King

- The market leader, properly with a two-times lead or better over its closest competitor.
- Kings enjoy a number of gorilla-like benefits, including economies of scale, favorable distribution terms, enhanced access to customers and partners, and favorable public relations.
- But because they lack architectural control, and because switching costs are low, they cannot force their competitors onto the defensive like gorillas.
- A king's power is neither as dramatic nor as persistent as a gorilla's, so you have to play much more cautiously and watch more closely for erosions in the king's position.

### Prince

- A market challenger, or potentially a coleader of a market that has no definable king. 
- Typically this company has around 10% to 15% market share.
- Princes make an interesting contrast to chimps:
	- On the downside, they have no proprietary barriers to entry to keep competitors at bay
	- On the upside, their competitors, even if they are kings, have no barriers to prevent the princes from attacking them.
	- Additionally, unlike the category of chimp, the category of prince permits aggressive merging.

### Serf

- This company often has 1% or less market share and is living hand-to-mouth off of opportunistic sales. 
- Individually these companies are insignificant, but taken collectively they serve a key role in the tornado, filling out the low end of the market, meeting the needs of those customers who cannot qualify for the attentions of a king or prince.


## Segmenting Gorillas

### The industry power of a software applications gorilla is less than that of an enabling technology gorilla.	

- the complexity of applications is such that it does not commoditize easily, and thus cannot proliferate as broadly or interoperate with other systems as intimately. 
- Application vendors have network effects only with entities immediately adjacent to their market space.
- Unlike their enabling-technology cousins, applications are the only products that the end-user customer ever actually sees. Therefore, whereas enabling products have the most industry power, application products have the most customer power.
	- So when markets are in the bowling alley, application vendors actually have greater power than enabling-technology vendors.
	- It is only after markets and infrastructures get swept up into the tornado, and customer demand can be increasingly taken for granted, that the power seeps down into the underlying layers.

### The core enabling-technology gorillas have the highest form of power in the gorilla game.	

- In enabling technologies, products commoditize extremely well, allowing them to proliferate into markets far afield from the original starting points and generate a high degree of network effects.
- Because all other vendors in the marketplace are ultimately both dependent upon and vulnerable to these gorillas, their behavior must be scrutinized on a daily basis, even if one were not invested in them.

## Scalability vs Barriers to Entry

- Both are required to sustain ongoing gorilla-like valuations. 
- However, the more scalable a market is, the more likely it is to intersect with another gorilla's turf, and the more challenging it is to keep other companies out. 
- Conversely, the higher the barriers to entry protecting a market, usually the more complex the solution is to replicate, and therefore the harder it is to scale the market. There is a trade-off, then, between scalability and barriers to entry.	
- Whenever this trade-off condition occurs, the barriers-to-entry play is safer in the short term, and the scalability play is safer in the long term. 

When two gorillas, each in the process of imperialistically expanding its territory, encounter each other and decide they must fight to the death, three things can happen, and two of them are bad:

1. Your gorilla loses out to the other gorilla.
1. Your gorilla wins, which leads to a dramatic uptick in the value of your portfolio, as the added value of ruling a new market supplements the already highly valued market cap of your gorilla's stock.
1. The two gorillas fight to a standstill.

## Valuing Gorillas

![Market Cap](imgs/market_cap.gif)

1. The gorilla's curve is starting out higher on the vertical axis than a normal company. That is because, given its extraordinary advantage in power, it is expected to have far higher revenues and far better earnings from the outset.	
1. Because it is in a hypergrowth market, its growth rate is far higher than normal, causing its curve to rise more steeply than otherwise would be possible. This makes for a fatter area under the curve.	
1. Because it is going to be the permanent leader of this new market that is currently in hypergrowth; that is, the leader not just during the tornado but for the full duration of Main Street as well. Investors have much higher confidence in its earnings projections. Indeed, they are willing to project these earnings as far into the future as they are willing to project the market itself. This makes for a much longer area under the curve.

### CAP Chart

![CAP Chart](imgs/cap_chart.gif)

**Note:** Lines represents a consensus in the investment community that can only be inferred through indirect means.

### CAP (Competitive Advantage Period)

The point at which the curved line intersects the risk-adjusted return line equates to some future date beyond which no further projections of competitive advantage are valued. 

The time interval between now and that date is the Competitive Advantage Period.

### EVA (Economic Value Added)

The shaded area under the curve represents the net present value of the company's anticipated future ability to create profits in excess of the minimum risk-adjusted rate of return. This is called the Economic Value Added (EVA), and the size of this area represents the size of the "good deal" for owning the stock. 

Changes in the size of this area, and this area alone, account for the overwhelming bulk of changes in a company's stock market valuation, and hence its stock price.	

## In Search of Hypergrowth Markets	

There are only two ways to outperform the market:

- Outreact it on a frequent basis (execute on the same insights and information that others use but do so faster than everyone else) 
- Outthink it (execute on different insights and information than others use). 
	- Outthinking is actually a form of outreacting, but on a much slower time scale. That is, the "outthinker" sees upcoming events before they hit the market's radar, and acts on them ahead of the market.
	- Outthinking the market is not as hard as it might sound, for the market does not think. 

### Value Chain

**Tornadoes occur when and only when a new value chain comes into existence.**

![High Tech Value Chain](imgs/value_chain.gif)

From left to right:

- Technology of a new and unique capability is being incorporated into products, which propose new and highly differentiated benefits to customers.
- For these benefits to be realized, the new products must be integrated into the world's existing systems, and the resultant whole product must be sellable through a sales channel. - That channel, in turn, must make a sale to the customer, who then must have the technical capabilities to internalize the new system. 
- At this point, if the end users adopt the new system, and it makes them more productive, then, and only then, do the economic buyers see a return on their purchase investment. 

### A Framework 

1. When evaluating tornado market opportunities, maintain focus on the state of the value chain, asking the following questions over and over again:			
	1. Can this value chain develop into a tornado mass market?
		
		If the answer is no, leave the sector. There will be no gorillas coming around here anytime soon. If the answer is yes, continue.			
	1. If so, what conditions are currently holding it back?			

		This is where you earn your stripes as a gorilla gamer. Nobody ever really knows the answer to this question, so the goal is to assemble ideas about it, and then take your own view. That view will drive the next phase of your tornado watch, as represented by the final two questions.
	1. Are these constraining conditions likely to be removed?			
		
		As an investor, you need to imagine what it might take to remove the obstacles you have identified as the key blocking forces holding back the tornado's formation. Once you have ideas, you can start evaluating the offers from particular companies to see if they might do the trick.			
	1. If so, when is the last remaining constraint likely to be removed, and by whom?

		This is a key caveat about betting on any breakthrough in a traffic jam. It doesn't do any good if the jam just re-forms a mile or two down the highway. In other words, until the value chain is operating effectively end to end, no value gets through. That's why it is important to postulate the last remaining constraint.	
1. As you are looking at constraints and their removal, remember the critical factor is the need to overcome complexity. As we said, complexity comes in two main forms, each overcome by a characteristic enabler:			
	1. Adoption complexity, overcome by the killer app.			
	1. Solution complexity, overcome by a streamlined whole product.			

## Investing Rules

**Rule 1. If the category is application software, buy in the bowling alley.**

- The application has been "designed into" the business processes of at least one specific vertical market, such that for the companies inside that segment, not buying is a bigger risk than buying.	
- This means that that company can maintain a privileged relationship with a defensible set of customers, and has first rights to serve up to that customer base any future technology.

**Rule 2. If the category is enabling hardware or software, buy at the start of the tornado.**

- A good signal to begin tornado buying is when trade magazines stop printing articles questioning the readiness of a new technology for prime time and start printing ones focused on who is the emerging market leader. 

**Rule 3: Buy a basket comprising all the gorilla candidates. Usually at least two, sometimes three, and normally no more than four companies.**

### Possible Investment Outcomes

- Now, when good processes produce good results, life makes sense, and all is well. 
- When bad processes produce bad results, all may not be well, but life still makes sense, and the intelligent person learns from the experience. 
- The hardest outcomes to handle, it turns out, are when bad processes produce good results and vice versa. 
	- Here most people make the mistake of preferring the good result with the bad process. This is painfully short-sighted and must lead to confusion and grief later.	
	- Instead, the correct response is to prefer the good process even when it generates a bad result. This is because the goal of prudent risk-taking is not to never fail; the goal is instead to win a lot more times than you lose.
